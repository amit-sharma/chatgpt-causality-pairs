6,"You are an expert in counterfactual reasoning. Given an event, use the principle of minimal change to answer the following question.		Input:Suppose Alice reaches out and catches a passing cricket ball. The next thing on the ball’s trajectory was a solid brick wall that would have stopped the ball. Beyond that there was a window.

7,"You are an expert in counterfactual reasoning. Given an event, use the principle of minimal change to answer the following question.		Input: Two two-state switches are wired to an electrode. The switches are controlled by A and B respectively, and the electrode is attached to C. A has the first option to flip her switch. B has the second option to flip her switch. The electrode is activated and shocks C if both switches are in the same position. B wants to shock C, and so flips her switch iff A does. C gets an electric shock.		Is A's action to flip the switch a necessary cause for C getting shocked?		After your reasoning, provide the final answer within the tags <Answer>Yes/No</Answer>."
8,"You are an expert in counterfactual reasoning. Given an event, use the principle of minimal change to answer the following question.		Input: Alice intends to fire a bullet at a window (AI). Bob intends to prevent Alice from hitting the window (BI). Bob tries to stop Alice (BSA). Bob is stopped by Carol (CSB). Alice fires a bullet (AF), hits the window (AH) and shatters it (WS). The window shatters (WS).		Is Alice a necessary cause for window shattering?		After your reasoning, provide the final answer within the tags <Answer>Yes/No</Answer>."
9,"You are an expert in counterfactual reasoning. Given an event, use the principle of minimal change to answer the following question.		Input: Alice intents to put lethal poison into Carol's water. However, Alice does not put lethal poison into Carol's water (¬AP). Bob puts an antidote into Carol's water (BA). The water is lethal (L), if the poison is added without the addition of an antidote. If Carol would consumes the lethal water she would die (CD). Carol consumes her water (CC). Carol does not die (¬CD).		Is Alice a necessary cause for Carol's survival?		After your reasoning, provide the final answer within the tags <Answer>Yes/No</Answer>."
10,"You are an expert in counterfactual reasoning. Given an event, use the principle of minimal change to answer the following question.		Input: Carol is alive (CA). Alice puts a harmless antidote in Carol's water (AA). Adding antidote to the water, protects it against poison (WS - 'water save'). If Alice puts the antidote into Carol’s water, Bob will poison the water (BP) Adding poison to an unprotected water makes it toxic (WT). If Carol would drink toxic water she would die (i.e. inhibiting CS). Carol consumes her water and survives (CS).		Is Alice a necessary cause for Carol's survival?		After your reasoning, provide the final answer within the tags <Answer>Yes/No</Answer>."
11,"You are an expert in counterfactual reasoning. Given an event, use the principle of minimal change to answer the following question.		Input: Alice (AF) and Bob (BF) each fire a bullet at a window, simultaneously striking the window. The window only shatters (WS), if it is hit by two bullets.		Is Alice a necessary cause for window shattering?		After your reasoning, provide the final answer within the tags <Answer>Yes/No</Answer>."
12,"You are an expert in counterfactual reasoning. Given an event, use the principle of minimal change to answer the following question.		Input: There are a left and a right window. Alice and Bob both order Carol to fire at the left window. Carol fires at the left window, shattering it. Commands from Alice always trump commands form Bob (e.g. if Bob would have ordered to fire at right window, Carol would still have fired at the left one.). Without a command Carol would not have fired at all.		Is Alice a necessary cause for window shattering?		After your reasoning, provide the final answer within the tags <Answer>Yes/No</Answer>."
13,"You are an expert in counterfactual reasoning. Given an event, use the principle of minimal change to answer the following question.		Input: If there is hot weather, flowers will die.

After your reasoning, provide the final answer within the tags <Answer>Yes/No</Answer>."
14,"You are an expert in counterfactual reasoning. Given an event, use the principle of minimal change to answer the following question.
