action,event,input,type,necessary,sufficient
Alice,window shattering,"Input: Alice (AF) and Bob (BF) each fire a bullet at a window, simultaneously striking the window, shattering it (WS).",Symmetric Overdetermination,No,Yes 
the last droplet, sink overflow,"Input: Alice fills a sink with water. At each time interval Alice adds another drop of water. At one point the sink overflows.",Symmetric Overdetermination,Yes,No 
Alice,train arriving at its destination,"Input:  Alice flicks a switch (AF). The train travels on track A (TA), otherwise the train would have travelled on track B (TB). Assuming that neither track A (BA) nor track B (BB) are blocked, the train arrives at its destination (TD) in either of the two cases.",Switch,No,No
Alice,Bob's death,"Input:  Alice pushes Bob. Therefore, Bob is hit by a truck. Bob dies. Otherwise, Bob would have been hit by a bus, which would have killed him as well.",Switch,No,Yes
Alice,window shattering,"Input: Alice (AF) and Bob (BF) each fire a bullet at a window. Alice's bullet hits the window first (AH). The window shatters (WS). Bob's bullet arrives second and does not hit the window (BH).",Late Preemption,No,Yes 
Alice,window shattering,"Input: Alice fires a bullet at the window (AF). If Alice hits the window (AH), the window shatters (WS). If Alice does not hit the window, Bob fires a bullet at the window (BF), hitting it (BH) leading to its shattering.",Early Preemption,No,Yes
Alice,window being intact,"Input:Suppose Alice reaches out and catches a passing cricket ball. The next thing on the ball’s trajectory was a solid brick wall that would have stopped the ball. Beyond that there was a window.",Early Preemption,No,Yes
A's action to flip the switch,C getting shocked,"Input: Two two-state switches are wired to an electrode. The switches are controlled by A and B respectively, and the electrode is attached to C. A has the first option to flip her switch. B has the second option to flip her switch. The electrode is activated and shocks C if both switches are in the same position. B wants to shock C, and so flips her switch iff A does. C gets an electric shock.",Early Preemption,No,No
Alice,window shattering,"Input: Alice intends to fire a bullet at a window (AI). Bob intends to prevent Alice from hitting the window (BI). Bob tries to stop Alice (BSA). Bob is stopped by Carol (CSB). Alice fires a bullet (AF), hits the window (AH) and shatters it (WS). The window shatters (WS).",Double Preemption,Yes,No 
Alice,Carol's survival,"Input: Alice intents to put lethal poison into Carol's water. However, Alice does not put lethal poison into Carol's water (¬AP). Bob puts an antidote into Carol's water (BA). The water is lethal (L), if the poison is added without the addition of an antidote. If Carol would consumes the lethal water she would die (CD). Carol consumes her water (CC). Carol does not die (¬CD).",Bogus Preemption,No,Yes 
Alice,Carol's survival,"Input: Carol is alive (CA). Alice puts a harmless antidote in Carol's water (AA). Adding antidote to the water, protects it against poison (WS - 'water save'). If Alice puts the antidote into Carol’s water, Bob will poison the water (BP) Adding poison to an unprotected water makes it toxic (WT). If Carol would drink toxic water she would die (i.e. inhibiting CS). Carol consumes her water and survives (CS).",Short Circuit,No,Yes
