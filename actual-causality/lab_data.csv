action,event,input,type,necessary,sufficient
Agent X,fire being doused,"Input: There is a fire in the chemistry lab. A can of water would douse the fire. Agents X and Y both spray a can of water each, dousing the fire.",Symmetric Overdetermination,No,Yes 
the last drop, tank overflow,"Input: Reagent X is being added to a tank. At each time interval, a drop of Reagent X is being added. At one point the tank overflows.",Symmetric Overdetermination,Yes,No 
Reagent X,crystal formation,"Input:  Reagent X is added to a mixture. The mixture becomes hot, otherwise the mixture would have remained cold. In both cases (hot or cold), the mixture would have turned to crystal. The mixture turns to crystal.",Switch,No,No
Reagent X,Sam's death,"Input:  Reagent X is added to a mixture, which leads to an explosion and kills Sam. Otherwise, Reagent Y in Sam's pocket would have infected him and killed him as well.",Switch,No,Yes
Reagent X,crystal formation,"Input: Any of Reagent X or Reagent Y can be added to a mixture to convert it into a crystal. Reagent X is added first and the mixture turns to crystal. Reagent Y is added later and but does not mix since the crystal is already formed.",Late Preemption,No,Yes 
Reagent X,crystal dissolving,"Input: Reagent X is added to a beaker containing a  crystal. If Reagent X touches the crystal, the crystal dissolves. If Reagent X does not touch the crystal, Sam adds Reagent Y which leads to the crystal dissolving.",Early Preemption,No,Yes
Sam,floor being contaminated,"Input: Sam reaches out and catches the falling test tube containing a contaminating reagent. The next thing on the test tubeâ€™s trajectory was a soft foam mattress which would have prevented the test tube from reaching the floor. Beyond that there was the floor.",Early Preemption,No,Yes
Sam,crystal formation,"Input: Sam intends to add reagent X to a mixture that would convert it to a crystal. Riya intends to prevent Sam from adding the reagent. Riya tries to stop Sam from adding the reagent, but Riya is stopped by Frank. Sam adds the reagent and the crystal is formed.",Double Preemption,Yes,No 
Sam,mixture not exploding,"Input: Sam intents to put Reagent X in a mixture to make it explode. However, Sam does not put the reagent in the mixture. Bob puts an anti-explosion Reagent Y into the mixture. The mixture would explode if Reagent X is added without the addition of Reagent Y. Mixture does not explode.",Bogus Preemption,No,Yes 
Sam,avoiding explosion,"Input: A test tube contains a mixture. Sam puts sand in the mixture. Adding sand to the mixture protects it against explosion. Only if Sam puts sand in the mixture, Riya will add Reagent Y to the mixture. Adding Reagent Y to a mixture makes it explode, unless the mixture already contains sand. There is no explosion.",Short Circuit,No,Yes
Reagent X,crystal formation,"Input: Reagent X and Y are both added to a mixture simultaneously and a crystal is formed. The crystal only forms if both reagents are added at the same time.",Miscellaneous,Yes,No
Sam,test tube breaking,"Input: There is a test tube on the left and a test tube on the right. Sam and Riya both order Frank to break the left test tube. Carol throws the left test tube, breaking it. Commands from Sam always trump commands form Riya (e.g. if Riya would have ordered to break the right test tube, Frank would still have thrown the left one.). Without a command Frank would not have acted at all.",Miscellaneous,Yes,Yes
Sam inaction,explosion,"Input: Sam is heating Reagent X in a beaker. If the heat is not stopped at the right time, the test tube would explode. Sam does not stop the heat. The test tube explodes.",Miscellaneous,Yes,Yes
Sam,Agent X's survival,"Input: Sam throws a poisonous test tube towards Agent X, who, after seeing it, ducks. The test tube misses Agent X and he survives.",Miscellaneous,No,No
