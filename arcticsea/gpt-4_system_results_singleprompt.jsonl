These changes in temperature and pressure can affect the geopotential height. However, this relationship is indirect and mediated by several factors.\n\nB. Changing Geopotential height can directly change Total cloud cover: Geopotential height is related to temperature, pressure, and air density, which can affect cloud formation. However, this relationship is also indirect and mediated by several factors.\n\nBased on the analysis, both relationships have indirect connections rather than direct causal relationships.
